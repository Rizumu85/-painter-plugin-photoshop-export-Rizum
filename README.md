# Photoshop Export Modified by Rizum - Substance 3D Painter plugin

This plugin is orinally from the Substance 3D Painter's Photoshop Export plugin and is now modified by Rizum, I added an option to specify dilation amount when padding is turn off, and remove the color correction from the original script that was changing the original colors of the layers.
从官方的PS插件改过来的，在设置里添加了加入像素溢出0-10的功能（需要在设置里关掉padding），原本插件的色差矫正因为反而把颜色变得糟糕，所以给改去掉了。

## Installation 安装
